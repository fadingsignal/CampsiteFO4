Campsite - Simple Camping for Fallout 4

Camping is obviously one of those mods everyone wants in Bethesda games, myself included since day one.  A month or so ago I jotted all my ideas down, and after I released Basement Living I set to work on this with the intent on making something simple, but still "immersive" and fun.  It ended up growing into what you see here.

Campsite adds craftable / carryable tents & sleeping bags (new meshes and HD textures in several colors, including camos), cloth wall, fires, lanterns, and cooking pot, each with their own unique gameplay dynamics, sounds, interactivity, and animations.  Simple enough for light play, detailed enough to make you feel involved.

When Survival Mode is out of beta this will be updated to include some new functionality, but the goal is to keep it very lightweight and simple!  It's very basic under the hood, and safe to be added mid-playthrough.  I don't suggest uninstall any mods mid-game, but this should be fairly safe to remove any time as well.
